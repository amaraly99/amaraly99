# Amar Aly

Senior Computer Engineering student at the **American University of Sharjah** focused on the **theory–to–systems pipeline of machine learning**: understanding model behavior, validating it empirically, and deploying it under real-world constraints.

I’m interested in *why* models work, *when* they fail, and *how* theoretical ideas survive contact with hardware, data noise, and operational limits. I value clean reasoning, reproducibility, and implementations that can be defended line-by-line.

Alongside research, I actively teach and build educational tools because explaining a concept is the fastest way to discover where understanding breaks.
